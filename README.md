Just a quick flash card game I put together to learn certain topics. Modify, add or delete the json data files in the `data` folder. In the current state, you need to modify script.js and add your data files to the array manually. Ideally, you could add some server-side code to fetch the list dynamically, but I've chosen to keep this simple for now.

A simple server can be downloaded if you have npm using `npm install http-server -g` but any simple http server capable of serving an index.html file should be able to run this.
